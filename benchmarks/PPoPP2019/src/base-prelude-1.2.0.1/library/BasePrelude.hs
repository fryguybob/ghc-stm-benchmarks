Like 'traceShow' but returns the shown value instead of a third value.

traceShowId :: (Show a) => a -> a
traceShowId a = trace (show a) a

{-|
Like 'trace' but returning unit in an arbitrary monad. Allows for convenient
use in do-notation. Note that the application of 'trace' is not an action in the
monad, as 'traceIO' is in the 'IO' monad.

>   y <- ...
>   traceM $ "y: " ++ show y
-}
traceM :: (Monad m) => String -> m ()
traceM string = trace string $ return ()

{-|
Like 'traceM', but uses 'show' on the argument to convert it to a 'String'.

> ... = do
>   x <- ...
>   traceShowM $ x
>   y <- ...
>   traceShowM $ x + y
